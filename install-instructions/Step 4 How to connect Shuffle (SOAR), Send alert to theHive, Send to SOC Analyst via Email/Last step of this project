    Response setup


How the workflow will look like:
    1. Mimikatz Alert Sent to Shuffle
    2. Shuffle Receives Mimikatz Alert (Extract SHA256 Hash from file)
    3. Check reputation score w/VirusTotal
    4. Send Details to TheHive to Create Alert
    5. Send email to SOC Analyst

Example Scenario
    ALERT: 
        Suspicious Rundll32.exe
        Outbound Connection
    
    TRIAGE:
        View Surrounding Events
        Identified Suspicious Domain

    RESEARCH:
        Wide-Spread Campaign
        Not a targeted attack

You can check (safely) what a malicious website or file would do (behaviour) if you click on it by using public.sqrx.com

Reponse Demo could look like this:
    1. Create Ubuntu Machine (lowest specifications ex. 1gb ram and 25hdd, allow all traffic inbound)
    2. install wazuh agent on ubuntu (watch ssh brute force activity)
    3. push all level 5 alerts to shuffle
    4. perform ip enrichment w/ virustotal
    5. send details via email to the user (ask to block source ip)
    6. create an alert in thehive
    7. automatically block ip if user confirms
